# Traction UI

A Vue front-end app to interact with the [Traction API](https://github.com/sanger/traction-service).

## Requirements

* Yarn; if using brew: `brew install yarn`
* Node

## Installation

Install the required libraries using yarn: `yarn install`

## Config using `.dotenv`

To specify the required config, use `.env` files by creating a `.env.<environment>.local` file and
add the config to it. The essential config required:

```bash
VUE_APP_TRACTION_BASE_URL=<url>
VUE_APP_PRINTMYBARCODE_BASE_URL=<url>
VUE_APP_SAMPLEEXTRACTION_BASE_URL=<url>
VUE_APP_LABEL_TEMPLATE_ID=<id>
VUE_APP_LOG=false
```

To enable logging and use the convenience method `this.log()` (from the `Helper.vue` mixin) instead
of `console.log()`, set `VUE_APP_LOG=true` in `.env.development.local`.

## Running

To run the app and have hot-reloads for development: `yarn run serve`

## Testing

### Lints and fixes files

```bash
yarn run lint
```

### Run your unit tests

```bash
yarn run test:unit
```

### Run your end-to-end tests

```bash
yarn run test:e2e
```

## Miscellaneous

### Current process

To see how the UI and service work, follow this process to get a run created.

1. Generate manifest in SS (this creates samples in tubes with barcodes and metadata)

    * 6630/sdb/sample_manifests
    * create manifests for 1D tubes
    * use Saphyr template
    * use Saphyr purpose
    * select study
    * select supplier
    * number of tubes required

1. Download sample manifest from SS - manifest looks like exec(?) we've created sample manifest for
Saphyr with minimal information

1. User adds data into sample manifest:
    * supplier
    * sample name
    * volume
    * common name (species)
    * etc.

1. Upload manifest in SS - creates the samples in SS within the tubes copy barcodes from SS
1. Import SS tubes in Traction UI
1. Paste barcodes in the text box 'Import Sample Extraction Tubes'
    * goes gets sample meta data from SS
    * creates samples in Traction in tubes with Traction barcode
    * redirected to samples table
    * shows the recently created sample
1. Create library from sample
    * select an enzyme
    * redirected to created library
    * creates a library
1. Print library tube barcode
1. Create a run
    * add a run name
    * scan in barcodes of library into each flowcell
